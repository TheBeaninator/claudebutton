# ClaudeButton

Repurpose weird HID devices into Claude control. Grab a cheap BLE remote / ring /
dial, translate its events into keystrokes, and inject them into whatever window
is focused — so you can drive a Claude Code session from a physical button.

## How it works

A single root daemon:
1. **Discovers & grabs** the input nodes of any device a profile claims (matched
   by evdev name). Grabbing means the device's native events (volume, cursor…)
   never reach the desktop — no side effects.
2. **Translates** each device's events with a built-in *translator* (see below).
3. **Injects** the resulting keystrokes through one shared uinput virtual
   keyboard (declared with a full key range so libinput routes it to the focused
   window).
4. **Survives** the cheap gadgets: one reader thread per device, re-grab on
   re-enumeration, and an optional BLE reconnect nudge when a device sleeps.

## Profiles are data, not code

Every device is a file in `profiles/` (`*.yaml`, `*.yml`, or `*.json`). It names
one of the built-in **translators** and supplies its parameters + key map. A new
device that fits an existing translator needs **no recompile** — just a new file.

Translators:
- **`gesture`** — device fakes a touchpad (canned swipe strokes). Classifies each
  stroke into `up/down/left/right/tap` and maps those to keys. Params: `tap_dist`,
  `map`.
- **`keymap`** — device sends real key codes; remap input key → output key.
  Params: `map` (e.g. `KEY_VOLUMEUP: KEY_UP`).

Add a translator kind (a new event→key algorithm) only for a genuinely novel
device; it's a small enum arm in `src/profile.rs` + `src/gesture.rs`-style logic.

### Example: `profiles/jx05.yaml`

```yaml
name: jx05
match:
  name_prefix: "JX-05"
reconnect:
  mac: "A7:B6:5E:94:60:D5"
  adapter: "00:1A:7D:DA:71:13"   # CSR dongle (antenna) — NOT the antenna-less Intel
translator:
  kind: gesture
  tap_dist: 400
  map:
    up: KEY_UP
    down: KEY_DOWN
    tap: KEY_ENTER      # center button
    left: KEY_ESC
    right: KEY_RIGHT    # accept autocomplete
```

## Onboard a new device

1. Pair it (BLE) or plug it in.
2. Scope what it emits with the built-in capture mode (grabs every node whose
   name contains the substring, prints raw events + gesture classification):

   ```
   sudo ./target/release/claudebutton capture JX-05
   ```

   Operate the device one action at a time and note whether it sends discrete
   `KEY`s (→ use a `keymap` translator) or `ABS`/`GESTURE` swipes (→ `gesture`).
3. Write `profiles/<name>.yaml` (or `.json`) with a `match` and the right
   translator + key map. Restart the service. Done — no recompile.

## Run

```
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/claudebutton         # foreground, from the project dir
# or install as a service (supersedes the old python jx05-remote):
./service/install.sh
journalctl -u claudebutton -f              # watch presses live
```

Runs as root: reads `/dev/input` and writes `/dev/uinput` with no group/ACL/udev
setup and no relogin; a root-created uinput keyboard reaches the active X session.

## Devices

| Profile | Device | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| jx05 | JX-05 BLE ring | 5-button D-pad; Jieli firmware fakes a touchpad. Full RE notes in `device-workshop/device-files/JX-05/skills.md`. **Use the CSR dongle, not the antenna-less Intel adapter.** |

## Roadmap

- Swap the `bluetoothctl` reconnect shell-out for the **`bluer`** crate — native
  connect + disconnect **signals** (drop the /proc poll entirely).
- More translators as new gadgets need them (relative dials/wheels, chords).
